# The Village \- GTM Strategy

| Company Name | The Village (Homewood Children’s Village \- Community Reinvestment & Revitalization Tooling) |
| One Sentence Value Proposition | The Village turns local service into on-chain community power by converting verified service hours and contributions into transparent funding for real neighborhood investment and revitalization..  |
| Unique Selling Proposition | The Village gives trusted community organizations a single operating system that links volunteer service, small contributions, and project funding directly to real properties and families in their neighborhood, with all flows verifiable on Aptos. Instead of separate tools for tracking hours, managing grants, and funding repairs, The Village connects them into one transparent loop that residents, staff, and funders can all see and trust.  |
| Product Description | The Village is an Aptos based toolkit that Homewood Children’s Village will use to connect three things that are usually siloed: volunteer engagement, community funds, and neighborhood revitalization. For the initial Homewood pilot, the product provides: A service ledger where HCV defines activities such as food distribution, tutoring, or block cleanups and staff approve resident hours. Approved hours mint an on chain credit (Time Dollars), issued only when staff validate participation. A community reinvestment fund that accepts those credits and, in later phases, stable assets, and attributes them as impact shares in specific projects. Simple dashboards and project views for staff, residents, and homeowners that show how service and contributions are flowing into concrete projects with clear goals and visible progress. Over time, this suite becomes a full stack community economic operating system that blends real world assets, time based incentives, charitable giving, and shared ownership into a coherent model aligned with community values. |
| Key Differentiator | **Anchor first, protocol second:** Built with and for Homewood Children’s Village, a long-standing institution with deep neighborhood trust, not as a speculative DeFi product in search of users. **Full loop, not a point solution:** Most tools handle either volunteering, fund distribution, or housing finance. The Village is designed to support all four pillars of community stability in one system: Immediate emergency stability (aid and micro grants) Ability to serve and contribute (time based earning) Long term wealth building (fractionalized projects and impact shares) Shared governance and power (modular DAO layer) **On chain transparency with off chain practicality:** Sensitive identity and program logic stay off chain while all economic flows and project states are recorded on Aptos for auditability and trust. **Template for other communities:** Contracts and patterns are designed so other neighborhoods, faith networks, and nonprofits can adopt the same architecture with their own branding and governance. |
| Market Positioning | Initial market: **Primary:** Community based organizations in disinvested neighborhoods that already coordinate volunteers and support distressed households (Homewood Children’s Village, community development corporations, multi service nonprofits). **Secondary:** Faith based organizations, housing ministries, and local coalitions that combine service programs with informal mutual aid or housing stabilization efforts. Why this is the right place: These organizations already track service hours, manage grants, and make ad hoc funding decisions for families, but they lack infrastructure to connect those actions into a transparent reinvestment loop. They have legitimacy with residents and funders, but not internal technical capacity to build on chain systems themselves. A successful pilot with HCV becomes a credible proof point that can be reused with similar organizations in other cities. |
| Positioning Statement | The Village empowers community based organizations to turn community service and contributions into transparent, on-chain neighborhood investment using Aptos powered credits, community funds, and impact share tracking.  |
| Problem Statement | *Community organizations struggle to connect participation to tangible community progress. Volunteers contribute time, businesses offer support, and homeowners face urgent needs, yet the value created across these efforts remains disconnected, untracked, and hard to channel into revitalization. Without tools that unify service, rewards, and reinvestment, staff feel overwhelmed, residents feel unseen, and neighborhoods struggle to build sustained momentum.* |

## Business Model and Monetization

Short term, this is funded through grants and philanthropic capital with HCV as the anchor operator.  
Long term, The Village’s business model looks like:  
**Implementation and training fees:**

* One time onboarding and configuration fees for new partners (data migration, activity design, governance setup).

  **Transactional or AUM style fees on managed capital pools (later phases):**

  * Small basis point fees on external capital flowing into community funds or fractionalized projects, aligned with impact outcomes.

  **Sponsored deployments:**

  * Foundations or civic partners fund the rollout of The Village to entire city ecosystems, with per organization or per neighborhood pricing.

# Product Roadmap & Business Model

## Roadmap

### Summary of your timeline/roadmap

*e.g., Over the next 90 days, we will run pre-launch awareness campaigns, activate quests and co-marketing partnerships, and officially launch our mainnet.*   
*Post-launch, we will focus on staking programs and scaling community growth.*

Over the next 90 days, we will focus on getting the core infrastructure live and proven in the field. That means completing the initial Move modules and deploying them to Aptos testnet, integrating Privy, KYC, and the essential frontend flows, and then activating a controlled Homewood pilot with HCV staff and a small group of residents so we can observe the full loop in a real program context.

After that first launch, we will shift our attention to refinement and scale. We will iterate on the user experience and data models based on what we learn from HCV’s staff and families, extend the governance and fractionalization modules to better support shared decision making and project ownership, and begin onboarding one to three additional organizations while pursuing sponsored city or network deployments that allow The Village to operate as shared infrastructure across multiple neighborhoods.

### Major Launch Phases & Key Metrics

*Highlight the major public dates people should track*

Architecture & Testnet Phase (Assembly period)

* Metric: Technical Architecture doc delivered, contracts deployed to testnet, basic flows working end to end.

Mainnet MVP Deployment

* Metric: Core modules live on mainnet, ≥50 on chain transactions, ≥50 unique wallets interacting.

Homewood Pilot Activation

* Metric: ≥100 signed in users, ≥100 hours logged, ≥75 validated hours, at least 1–2 projects funded to milestone.

Replication & Network Building

* Metric: 3–5 new organizations in the pipeline, 2 additional pilots in design.

### Critical Dependencies

*List anything that must happen before a phase can start*

Stable Aptos mainnet and indexer access.  
HCV staff capacity and alignment with program calendars.  
KYC partner integration and basic compliance review.  
Clear communication around non-speculative nature of the pilot.

### Traction / Metrics

*Show evidence of progress or validation. If pre-launch, outline upcoming milestones (e.g., alpha, beta, partnerships).*

* Current usage, volume, or revenue.  
* Growth rates, retention, or engagement metrics.  
* Early partnerships, pilots, or feedback from key users.

## Competitive Landscape

### **Competitors / Comparables**

* Web3 impact platforms like ImpactMarket, Gitcoin Grants, and some Celo ecosystem initiatives.  
* Donation platforms like The Giving Block or Endaoment that route crypto philanthropy to nonprofits.  
* Traditional volunteer and case management tools (Salesforce NPSP, proprietary nonprofit CRMs).

### **Key Differentiation**

* Unlike donation platforms, The Village ties service, credits, and project funds together rather than just routing money.  
* Unlike generic DAO tooling, it is designed around neighborhood revitalization and distressed homes, not protocol governance.  
* Unlike traditional CRMs, it uses Aptos to provide verifiable, on-chain evidence of participation and reinvestment, while remaining adoptable by non-technical staff.
