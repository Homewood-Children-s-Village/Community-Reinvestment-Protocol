"INTRODUCTION"
"🚀 WELCOME TO APTOS ASSEMBLY!"
"💡 What is an MVP? A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a simplified version of your product built to validate market demand as early as possible. It contains just enough features to deliver value to real users and test whether your solution resonates with the target audience. While a Proof of Concept (POC) is typically internal and focused on validating technical feasibility, the MVP is external and customer-focused—designed to learn from real-world usage.   🚀 Why build an MVP? An MVP allows your team to: Launch a usable version of your product fast.Start testing your value proposition in the market with real users.Gather feedback to improve product-market fit before scaling up.An MVP isn’t about building less, it’s about building the right things first. It's not just a prototype—it should offer a functional experience that solves a real problem, even if it’s minimal.   ⚠️ Keep in mind: An MVP should feel like a complete experience, even if it’s simple under the hood. Don’t focus on building a perfect version—focus on learning quickly. What matters is whether users get value and keep coming back. MVPs are often small in scope but big in insight. The example on the right illustrates this well: don't build a wheel if the user needs a ride. Start with something like a skateboard—usable, valuable, and improvable.   📚 Learn More:   This bootcamp follows the Design Sprint methodology created at Google Ventures.

"Day 1: DEFINE YOUR MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)"
"BRAINSTORM THE PROBLEM"
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  Before defining your product or features, you need to explore the full range of problems your project could solve. This exercise is about brainstorming as many relevant and important issues as possible — especially those that are real pain points for users. Your goal is quantity over perfection — the refinement comes later. ✨ What does it mean to brainstorm problems?  Brainstorming problems means generating a wide list of challenges, frustrations, or unmet needs that your target users experience in a particular domain or context. Don’t try to craft perfect statements or narrow things down just yet. Instead, explore every angle of what feels broken or inefficient in your users’ world. These could include:  - Pain points in their current experience  - Barriers that prevent them from completing a task  - Unmet needs they try to work around  - Frustrations they regularly express     ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (15 minutes) 1. Set a timer for 10 minutes — This is a fast-paced brainstorming session. Don’t overthink or self-edit. 2. Individually or with your team, write down as many user problems as you can 3. Use sticky notes or a Miro frame — 1 problem per note.   💡 Pro Tip  When listing problems, try to frame them from the user’s perspective and avoid vague phrasing like “the lack of...”. Instead, write them as: “Users struggle to…” “People feel frustrated when…” “It’s hard for users to…” "
"BRAINSTORM YOUR PROBLEM HERE: "
"It is difficult to mobilize community members to serve the community"
"Raffles and regular incentive campaigns often don't provide enough incentives  for volunteering"
"It can be overwhelming to keep track of participation"
"Difficult to prove impact to funders"
"Business want to support community programs but don't have clear mechanisms that fit into their operations"
"It is hard to test new financial tools safely w/o risking regulatory issues or confusion"
"Difficult showing the connection between community actions and outcomes"
"Organizations struggle to channel small donations and investment into meaningful/visible prokects"
"Residents who inherit distressed property don't have a simple way to access capital or community support"
"It is difficult to communicate complex tools like DAOs, RWAs and tokens to community members"
"There is a clack of transparency/clarity about how some aid is distributed and the decision making process"
"Community organizations rarely have a unified dashboard that can surface project progress and community participation"
"Community members often feel decisions are made about neighborhood revitalization FOR them NOT WITH them"
"Community organizations struggle to integrate their efforts into a holistic solution"
"Homeowners struggle to access small infusions of capital without predatory loans."
"Supporters outside the neighborhood feel uncertain when they cannot see direct, visible impact from their contributions."
"It is unclear to people who care about the community how they can help"
"Residents struggle to see the personal benefit of volunteering when life pressures make time scarce."
"Staff feel discouraged when volunteers stop showing up because their efforts don't feel meaningful."
"Community members struggle to believe that their participation will actually shift neighborhood outcomes."
"Organizations struggle to coordinate volunteers, families, donors, etc"
"Community members feel frustrated when they can connect their work to real change"
"Homeowners struggle to maintain inherited properties when repair costs feel overwhelming."
"Program managers struggle to bridge the gap between “innovation” and “daily operations.”"
"EXAMPLE"
"Small merchants in emerging markets can’t accept digital payments without relying on unreliable third parties. "
"Peer-to-peer payments across borders are slow, expensive, and often blocked by intermediaries. "
"Merchants struggle with chargebacks, fraud, and lack of visibility on incoming funds. "
"Payment apps are country-locked or don’t support local currencies. "
"Bank accounts are required to use most fintech tools. "
"Settlement takes days, not seconds. "
"REFINE THE PROBLEM"
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise? Now that you’ve surfaced a wide range of user problems, it’s time to narrow your focus. The goal here is to identify the 1 to 3 most important problems your project will tackle in the next 2–3 months of development. This becomes the core of your product direction. You’ll also be asked to translate those problems into clear, user-centered problem statements, which will guide your design, development, and communication.   ✨ What is a Problem Statement?  A problem statement is a precise, user-focused way to describe a real issue — not a missing feature or your imagined solution. A good problem statement is:  - Focused on the user’s experience  - Grounded in what’s actually broken  - Free from assumptions about the solution 🚫 Avoid: “There’s no platform that helps creators monetize NFTs.” (This already suggests a platform is the answer.) ✅ Instead: “Independent creators struggle to earn consistent income from their NFT work despite having an engaged audience.” (This describes the pain, not the fix.)   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (15 minutes) - Review your brainstormed problems (5 min) - Group similar ideas where needed. - Prioritize 1 to 3 key problems (5 min) - Summarize them into a singular Problem Statement "
"REFINE THE PROBLEM HERE: "
" Engagement & Participation Volunteers don’t see tangible benefits from service. Service hours feel invisible or unrecognized. Residents don’t see how their actions affect neighborhood outcomes. Participation feels disconnected from real community progress. "
"Transparency & Impact Measurement Staff struggle to track hours and approvals across programs. It’s hard to demonstrate impact to funders or the community. Multiple disconnected systems make reporting a burden. Residents cannot see how their effort connects to revitalization. "
"Community Revitalization Participation Residents feel revitalization is happening around them, not with them. People cannot easily support or co-own neighborhood improvements. Diaspora supporters can’t see trustworthy, trackable projects. Homeowners struggle to find community-backed pathways to support repairs."
"Write down a succinct problem statement that encapsulates the essence of what you're solving."
"Community organizations struggle to connect participation to tangible community progress. Volunteers contribute time, businesses offer support, and homeowners face urgent needs, yet the value created across these efforts remains disconnected, untracked, and hard to channel into revitalization. Without tools that unify service, rewards, and reinvestment, staff feel overwhelmed, residents feel unseen, and neighborhoods struggle to build sustained momentum."
"Operational Complexity Staff feel overwhelmed piloting new tools or programs. It’s difficult to coordinate volunteers, rewards, redemptions, and projects. Organizations lack a simple, unified way to manage engagement + rewards + reinvestment. "
"EXAMPLE"
"Write down a succinct problem statement   Small merchants lack direct, reliable tools to accept and manage stablecoin payments—especially across borders—leaving them dependent on banks, intermediaries, and fragmented infrastructure."
"Small merchants need a fast and direct way to accept digital payments without banks or middlemen. "
"Cross-border customers want to pay using stablecoins, but local offramps and interfaces are missing. "
"Merchants need visibility and control over incoming payments in real time. "
"👤 DEFINE THE USER PERSONAS"
"DEFINE THE USERS PERSONA HERE: "
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  You can’t build a product for “everyone.” To create something meaningful, you need to understand who you’re building for and what their world looks like. This exercise helps you define clear user personas — archetypes that represent the goals, needs, and behaviors of your key user segments. These personas will guide your design decisions, prioritize your features, and sharpen your communication throughout the Bootcamp and beyond.   ✨ What is a User Persona? A user persona is a fictional-yet-realistic profile that captures the essence of a particular type of user — their goals, frustrations, and how they behave. Personas are not guesses or just demographic snapshots. They’re strategic tools to keep your team aligned on: Who your users are What they’re trying to achieve Why your product should exist for them You can (and should) create more than one persona if your product serves distinct groups. But the more personas you have the more complex your app will be.   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (10–15 minutes) Set a timer for 10–15 minutes - Keep it focused. If you’re unsure, work from your assumptions — you’ll refine with real user feedback later. Define 1–2 primary user personas   📚 Additional Resources How to Create User Personas with Examples","https://alvinhermanto.medium.com/how-to-create-user-personas-with-examples-4f705baa55b6"

This will help you design a focused MVP that delivers clear value from day one.   ✨ What is the Golden Path?  The Golden Path is the main, happy-path user flow — the smoothest and most direct way a user reaches their goal with your product. It ignores edge cases and exceptions, and focuses only on the steps where your product creates the most value.

This exercise uses User Story Mapping to help you identify what needs to be built at each step of your Golden Path so you can deliver a product that actually works for your users.   ✨ What is User Story Mapping?  User Story Mapping breaks down your high-level user journey into the actual tasks and interactions that users go through at each step. This includes:  - What users do  - What they need to see or understand -  What options or tools help them move forward By expanding each Golden Path step, you’ll expose what needs to be designed, built, or clarified — and prepare for the MoSCoW prioritization.   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (20–25 minutes)  - Copy your Golden Path steps (from previous exercise) across the top of your board.  Limit: 5–6 main steps.  - For each step, list out detailed user actions below.

"DEFINE YOUR POC, MVP & MMP HERE: "
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  You’ve mapped out the full user experience — now it’s time to prioritize what to build and when. Using the MoSCoW method, you’ll break your product plan into three stages: What you’ll build in the next 3 weeks (POC) What comes next (MVP) What comes later (MMP) This will help you stay lean, deliver value fast, and clearly communicate your product roadmap.   ✨ What is the MoSCoW Method?  MoSCoW is a prioritization framework that helps you decide what features Must, Should, Could, and Won’t be included — based on impact and timing. You’ll apply this to the user actions and tasks identified in your User Story Map. Define your roadmap in three phases: 🧪 POC (Proof of Concept) — What you’ll build during the next 3 weeks (core flow only) 🚀 MVP (Minimum Viable Product) — What comes next (3–4 months) for pilot testing or grant milestones 🛠️ MMP (Minimum Marketable Product) — What you'd launch in a real market (6–12 months)   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (15–20 minutes)  - Review your User Story Map   - Focus on the user actions and features you listed under each step.  - Sort each task using MoSCoW:  - Must Have – Critical for your POC to function  - Should Have – Needed for your MVP  - Could Have – Nice to have but not essential for initial testing  - Won’t Have (for now) – Out of scope, revisit later  - Assign each task to a phase:   - POC = Only Must Haves   - MVP = Must + Should Haves   💡 Tip: Keep your POC tight.

Natural? Focused?  - Choose the strongest version or ask for quick feedback from your team or mentor.   💡 Tip: Start by filling in this structure: [Product] is a [what it is] for [who it's for] that [solves what problem or delivers what value].

"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  To estimate the effort required for each user story in your POC, so you can better plan your development timeline and identify potential risks early.   ✨ What is sizing and why does it matter? Sizing means assigning a relative effort level to each user story using simple buckets — from Small (S) to Extra Large (XL). This helps you:  - Understand which tasks are quick wins  - Spot complex or risky work that needs breaking down  - Plan your sprint realistically A rough estimate is enough here — precision comes later.   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (20 minutes) Review your POC user stories from your story map. Estimate each story’s size using this guide: S (Small): ~1–2 days (2 points) — e.g., “Create login form” M (Medium): ~2–3 days (3 points) — e.g., “Design landing page with dynamic content” L (Large): ~5–10 days (5 points) — e.g., “Set up user roles and permissions” XL (Extra Large): ~1 full sprint (8 points) — e.g., “Build admin dashboard with analytics” If a story is L or XL, break it down into smaller parts — no L's XLs should remain."

"Lo-Fi Wireframes"
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  To create low-fidelity wireframes that visually map out your app’s layout and user flows. These mockups will help you and your team align on the structure, key screens, and core interactions — before diving into design or development.   ✨ What is a Low-Fidelity Wireframe?  A low-fidelity wireframe is a simple sketch of a screen — no colors, no detailed styling, just the layout. It shows: Where buttons, text, and forms go How users move from one screen to the next What happens at each step in the user journey Think of it as a blueprint for your product’s UX — quick to make and easy to change.   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (30–45 minutes) Choose your tool — use the provided wireframe tool, Figma, Miro, or even pen and paper. Create 3–5 core screens per user journey based on your Golden Path. Keep it simple — use boxes, labels, and arrows. Focus on flow, not design.   💡 Tip: Imagine watching someone use your app for the first time. What do they need to see, understand, and do — and in what order?"
"Journey 4: Distressed Homeowner / Property Owner Goal: A local homeowner with a distressed property brings it into the program, understands how community-backed funding works, reviews and signs the equity offering agreement (combining on-chain and off-chain legal processes), and tracks renovation progress and obligations."
"Journey 2: Staff / Validator Goal: A local organization staff member reviews pending hours, approves them to mint Time Dollars, and monitors aggregate community fund metrics."
"Journey 1: Community Member / Volunteer Goal: A community member serves, earns Time Dollars, uses them for in-kind services or stakes them into a community reinvestment project, then sees their impact."

"DAY 3: OUTLINE THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE - "
"HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW: C4 DIAGRAMS"
"🎯 What is the goal of this exercise?  To define and document the technical architecture of your solution using the C4 model. This high-level overview will help you and others — including Aptos technical reviewers — understand how your system works, how its parts connect, and how it interacts with the Aptos blockchain and other external systems.   ✨ What are C4 Diagrams?  The C4 model breaks down a software system into four layers of abstraction — from the big picture to detailed components. It's a clear, structured way to visualize your architecture:  - Context Diagram – Shows how your system fits into the larger environment (users, external systems, Aptos components, etc.)  - Container Diagram – Outlines the major pieces of your system (e.g., frontend, backend, databases, wallets)  - Component Diagram – Breaks down the internal structure of each container (e.g., modules, services, APIs)   ⏳ How to Complete This Exercise (60–90 minutes) Use the template provided (link from the Aptos team). This will guide your documentation and C4 layout. Start from the top down: Create a Context Diagram: Who uses your system? What external services does it talk to? Then define Containers: What are the main deployable pieces (frontend, backend, wallets, etc.)? Next, break those down into Components: APIs, smart contracts, services, modules   💡 Tip: Don’t overcomplicate it. Your goal is clarity — enough detail for someone technical to understand what you're building and how it's structured.   "

"DAY 4: CREATE YOUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY "
"COMPLETE THE PRODUCT GO-TO-MARKET CANVA"
"Target Market:"
"Problem?"
"🎯 What’s the goal of this exercise?  To define and execute your first concrete steps to get early adopters using your product. Don’t wait for perfection—just focus on talking to real users now.   ✨ What is this tool?  This GTM Canvas is a quick and dirty framework to help you find your first beta testers and learn from them fast. It’s not about building a full marketing strategy—it’s about finding the shortest path to real feedback.   🌀 How the Early GTM Loop Works  Use this canvas to kick off your first loop: PLAN (Define your actions for the next 1–2 weeks) EXECUTE (Reach out, talk to users, put your offer in front of people) LEARN (What worked? What flopped?) ITERATE (Tweak your messaging, target, or tactics—and repeat)   🛠️ How to Use the Canvas (30–45 minutes)  Answer the following prompts to map out your first GTM sprint: Who is your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)? What problem are you solving for them? Why should they care? What’s your hook or unique value? Where do they hang out? (Online communities, events, forums, etc.) What’s your offer or CTA? (Invite to beta, feedback session, etc.) What will you measure to learn? (Replies, signups, sessions, feedback) What are your next 3 concrete actions? "
"who is your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)? Remember  you’re focusing on “doing things that don’t scale” by targeting the early adopters."
"what problem are you solving for your ICP? Why should they listen to you?"
"EXAMPLE"
"Crypto-literate small merchants that Sell through WhatsApp, Instagram, or Telegram, Already receive or want to receive payments in USDT/USDC, Struggle with unreliable payment systems, chargebacks, or currency volatility"
"Target"
"Offer / message"
"Distribution:"
"What will you say to your customers? What action do you want them to take (e.g., join your waiting list)? Remember, this is about them; make it relevant for them and be authentic!"
"How will you reach out to these customers? Remember, we are about “doing things that don’t scale”? Approach here. Think: is there an easy, direct approach?"
"Can’t use Stripe or PayPal due to geography or compliance"
"Informal crypto payments are risky (no protection, no delivery guarantees) "
"No easy tool to generate a payment link or handle cross-border payments with trust "
"Problem"
"Direct outreach in crypto merchant WhatsApp & Telegram groups "
"Voice message walkthroughs demoing the flow"
"Distribution"
"“Want to get paid in USDC without worrying about scams or chargebacks?  We’ll set you up with a free, secure payment link that holds funds until your buyer confirms delivery.” CTA: Send us a DM or click to launch your link in 2 minutes. Optional incentive: First 10 sellers get free setup support + social promo."
"Message / offer"
"Get 10 real merchants to complete one transaction using the escrow payment link.  This includes setup, buyer payment, delivery, and successful fund release."
"Goal"
"Whats your Goal?"
"Set a clear, measurable goal you can accomplish in the next week. For example: “I will get 20 users to sign up to my waiting list."
